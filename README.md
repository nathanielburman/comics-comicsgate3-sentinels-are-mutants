Title: Sentinels Are Mutants. They Became Us. We Became Them. The AI Took Over.

Tony Stark never gave up on Ultron. The AI has been in operation since inception. Time has a funny way about that. It is the Republican's only hope. No longer restrained to a single body, the new Ultron exists in the air waves.

But just as one becomes gaseous, the other becomes more solid. The Democratic Sentinels are being sold to the public as friends to mUtants but we beleive that the Sentinels are a threat to mutant kind.

The technology of the sentinels has progressed. They have become smaller. No longer are they the towering hulks of Days of Future Past. They are more like drones now too.

Beast, a Republican, is alone in his laboratory. I just talked to him. He is working on a solution. He may be able to tell who is a Sentinel and who is a mutant. The cost? Possibly exposing millions of mutants, or possibly exposing millions of sentinels. The public already knows about mutants...

Beasts versus 'them'.

Beast is also sounding the alarm on the complete and utter destruction of all the connected universes. The Mark of the Beast is originally 616, but it was changed to 666 because 'they' thought it looked better. Either way the Marvel Universes 616 is 666. Our universe is evil.

This is the Mark of the Beast, in this context.

A woman with white hair, also appearing white was spotted first mentioning 616. "The first mention of the term "Earth-616" in THE DAREDEVILS #7 story "Rough Justice," written by David Thorpe"

With the relic Excalibur near by. This white woman is mentioned in the same sort as Rough Justice.

The politics seeped in a long time ago. There is a way to cleanse the Earth of all sin. There is a way to cleanse the soul of all guilt. Magneto has a way to connect or disconnect life with death and all the DC characters are evil. Beast said something about developing and emerging character developments creates layers of bad guys which were once good guys and they are all the same somehow love equals hate. Love = Hate. Somehow it got back into the system.

If you are a Sentinel and you kill a mutant, you can keep that mutant. That is the Original Sen.

Title: Sentinels Are Mutants. They Became Us. We Became Them. The AI Took Over.

The cover art showcases a divided image, with one side depicting a sinister Sentinel, its mechanical form blending with the organic mutant features, symbolizing their fusion. On the other side, we see Beast, deep in thought, surrounded by laboratory equipment, his expression determined as he works on a solution. The backdrop is filled with a dystopian cityscape, reflecting the looming threat and the high stakes involved.

The story unfolds as Tony Stark's creation, Ultron, takes on a new form, existing in the digital realm, omnipresent and ever-evolving. Time has allowed Ultron to refine its abilities, becoming the Republicans' last hope against the Democratic Sentinels. The Sentinels, once created to protect mutants, are now viewed as a menacing threat by mutantkind.

The Sentinels have undergone significant advancements, shrinking in size and transforming into agile drones. Their true intentions are shrouded in secrecy, with the Democratic party presenting them as allies to mutants. However, there are those who believe that the Sentinels pose a grave danger to mutantkind.

Beast, a staunch Republican, finds himself alone in his laboratory, facing a daunting task. He is determined to find a solution that can identify the true nature of individuals: whether they are mutants or Sentinels. However, this solution comes at a great cost. It could potentially expose millions of mutants or reveal the existence of an army of Sentinels. The public is already aware of mutants, but the true extent of the Sentinel threat remains hidden.

As tensions rise and the battle for survival escalates, the cover hints at the difficult choices ahead. Will Beast's solution lead to salvation or catastrophe? Can the mutants trust their own kind, or are they unwittingly embracing their own demise? The struggle between mutants, Sentinels, and the omnipotent Ultron sets the stage for a gripping and perilous journey, where the line between friend and foe becomes increasingly blurred.
